// C Program to demonstrate use of bitwise operators

/*
    1. The & (bitwise AND) in C or C++ takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers. 
    The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1.
  
    2. The | (bitwise OR) in C or C++ takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers. 
    The result of OR is 1 if any of the two bits is 1. 

    3. The ^ (bitwise XOR) in C or C++ takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of two numbers. 
    The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different. 

    4. The << (left shift) in C or C++ takes two numbers, left shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift. 

    5. The >> (right shift) in C or C++ takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift. 

    6. The ~ (bitwise NOT) in C or C++ takes one number and inverts all bits of it.
